Tired of losing at scrabble-like games? You’re not alone! If you can't beat your opponent on your own, it’s time to think of some dirty tricks. ;)

Here’s how: given a word list (attached here) and a scrabble board with just one horizontal word on it, use the letters in your rack to earn as many points as possible placing a vertical word on the board.
The scrabble board is simplified: there are no special score boosters, and it has unlimited size in all directions.
Rules
It is forbidden to extend the horizontal word on the board. Your vertical word must cross one of its letters.
Move allowed (HELL in the board):
 M
HELL
 N
Move not allowed (HELL in the board):
    H
HELLO
    U
    R
Score calculation
The score of a word is the sum of all its letters (including the letters of the horizontal word) using the following table:
1 point: A E I L N O R S T U
2 points: D G
3 points: B C M P
4 points: F H V W Y
5 points: K
8 points: J X
10 points: Q Z
Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, C, and C test cases follow. Each test case consists of a line with two strings, the letters in your rack (R) and the word on the board (B). 1 <= strlen(R) <= 25 , 1<=strlen(B) <= 25
Output
For each test case, output one line containing the best word found, and its score separated by a space. Ex. WORD SCORE. If there is more than one word with maximum score, the output should be the one with lower alphanumeric order.
