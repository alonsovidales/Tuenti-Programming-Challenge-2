Everyday we need more passwords to access the growing number of services available online.
We usually don't care if they are weak, but some of them are very important, as those used in online banking. For that reason, each bank has thought of a different way to protect their customers and allow secure transactions.
A common method is to ask the user for some random characters from a password. For example, they may ask for the 1st, 3rd, and 5th characters; and if the password is 325467, the correct answer would be: 356.
But is this method really secure? If someone gets the different subcodes, could he recover the full password?
Given that the characters are always asked for in order, and assuming that passwords do not contain repeated characters, your objective is to find all the possible correct passwords.
Input
One line for each subcode used in a successful transaction. Subcodes contain only alphanumeric characters (0-9, A-Z, a-z).
Output
The shortest valid password(s). If there is more than one possible password, output all of them (one per line) in alphabetical order.
Sample input
2Ad
12c
2Ac
2Bc
1cd
1xZ
1dx
BdZ
Sample output
12ABcdxZ
12BAcdxZ
