You are a genius working for one of the most famous high-frequency trading firms in the world. But you are an evil genius and have found a backdoor that lets you add fake operations in the last second with all the daily stock information available. Having all the information, you can choose when to buy some shares and when to sell them and get maximum profit. Of course, you don't want to be greedy and draw attention to the operations and get caught, so you limit them to one buy and sell per day. Since it's a high-frequency trading system and you expect a big input, you design a program that reads all the stock information with 100ms resolution, gives the time when you want to add the buy and sell operations (in milliseconds) and tells you the expected gain. Of course, you want the maximum gain for that transaction.
Input
One line with an integer for each stock sample.
Output
The starting (when you buy) and ending (when you sell) point of the transaction in milliseconds and the expected gain.
