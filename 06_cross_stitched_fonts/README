If geeks had to pick their favourite embroidery technique, there is no doubts that cross-stitch would be the chosen one: it’s all about pixels, fabric resolution and sprites! So, to celebrate National Craft Week we are going to cross-stitch messages to decorate handmade cards that will then be sold to raise funds for orphan sheep in New Zealand.
Materials for cross-stitching are quite simple: cloth, a needle and thread. There are many kinds of fabrics for cross-stitching, all of them available in different resolutions or counts. The count (ct) is the number of pixels (or stitches) per inch of cloth, for example, 14ct indicates 14 pixels per inch.

We have some rectangular fabric pieces and messages to stitch, and we want to use all possible space with maximum font size (measured in pixels or stitches) without splitting words across lines. As good geeks, we will use a monospace font for the message, therefore all characters, including whitespaces, take up the same space (both in vertical and horizontal). We must leave a whitespace between words, but we will not leave any between different lines.
In order to buy enough thread, we have estimated that each stitch uses 1/(fabric ct) inches of thread, and that the average number of stitches per character (except the whitespace!) is (font size)2/2. For example, if we use a 14ct fabric with a font size of 14, then each character will use an average of 7’’ of thread.
Your task is to compute the minimum amount of thread we need to order. We cannot order fractions of an inch, that is, if we need 16.6'' of thread, we will order 17''.
Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, C, and C test cases follow. Each test case consists of 2 lines. The first one contains 3 integers, W, H and ct, indicating respectively width, height (in inches) and count of the piece of fabric. The next line contains the message we want to stitch. The text can contain digits, upper and lower-case letters, space characters (but no tabs or newlines) and some symbols:
0-9 a-z A-Z
!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[] ^_`{|}~ 
The text will not start with whitespaces, nor will there be two adjacent space characters. 
Output
For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: P", where x is the case number (starting from 1) and P is the minimum thread length (in inches) we would need if we stitched the message using the maximum size possible for the characters. If it’s not possible to fit the message, output 0.
Limits
1 ≤ C ≤ 30 
1 ≤ W, H, characters in message ≤ 5000 
1 ≤ ct ≤ 100
